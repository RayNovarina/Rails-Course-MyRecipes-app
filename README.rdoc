Authentication:

What we have already:
 - Chef model and validations
  - chef table with columns name and email
  
What we need to do:
 # Add passwords to the chefs table so chefs can be authenticatedand logged in
 # Use email as log in credentials, since email is unique
 # Ability to register new chefs to use the app
 - Ability to display chefs profile
 - Ability to list chefs using the app
 - Ability for chefs to log in and log out of the app
* if logged_in? && @recipe.chef == current_user

=================================================
TDD: Test Driven Development
1) Spec it out
2) Define a test method with descriptive name
3) Create a failure case
4) Test for success
5) Implement the production code/functionality to make the test pass.
